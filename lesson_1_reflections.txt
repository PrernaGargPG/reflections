How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It showed me the syntatical difference between them. 

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    You could see why you did what you did.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Its my choice when to commit.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    In programming, we have related files more frequently.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Just type them in the terminal :P

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    You can always revert back using git checkout. 

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    For logging my programs.
