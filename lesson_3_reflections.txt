Q 1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Ans. When I want to collaborate with others on my project. 

Q 2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Ans. Because there might be some changes by other contributors that I don't want to incorporate in my local repository.
